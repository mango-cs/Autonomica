# ‚ö° Lightning Path Simulator

An advanced 2D grid-based electrical simulation where lightning seeks grounded paths through various conductive and semi-conductive materials. Experience realistic electrical behavior with branching arcs, burn trails, and chain reactions!

## üåü Features

### Core Simulation
- **Realistic Pathfinding**: Lightning uses advanced algorithms to find optimal paths from clouds to ground
- **Material Properties**: Each material has unique conductivity, resistance, and electrical characteristics
- **Branching Logic**: Creates chaotic bolts with natural forking structures and secondary arcs

## üî¨ Physics & Algorithms

### Pathfinding Algorithm
The simulation uses a weighted breadth-first search with dynamic resistance calculation:

1. **Resistance Calculation**: Each cell's resistance depends on:
   - Base material resistance
   - Arc randomness factor
   - Gravitational bias (favors downward movement)
   - Diagonal movement penalty
   - Conductivity threshold checks

2. **Branching Logic**: 
   - Primary paths spawn secondary branches at random points
   - Branches avoid main paths and seek alternative routes
   - Branch probability increases with path length and discharge strength

3. **Chain Reactions**:
   - Time-delayed secondary arcs near conductive materials
   - Cascading effects through connected conductor networks

### Material Physics
- **Breakdown Voltage**: Insulators can be overcome with sufficient discharge strength
- **Conductivity Weighting**: Higher conductivity materials attract lightning paths
- **Resistance Networks**: Complex interactions between different material combinations

## üéØ Simulation Tips

### Creating Interesting Scenarios
1. **Lightning Rods**: Place conductors vertically to guide lightning safely to ground
2. **Maze Challenges**: Use insulators to create complex routing puzzles
3. **Network Effects**: Connect conductors to create branching opportunities
4. **Mixed Materials**: Combine semi-conductors with insulators for realistic behavior

### Optimal Settings
- **High Chaos**: Max randomness (100%) for wild, unpredictable bolts
- **Precision Strikes**: Low randomness (10-20%) for more predictable paths  
- **Storm Mode**: High discharge strength (15-20) with multi-strike enabled
- **Subtle Effects**: Low burn trail duration for clean visualization

### Performance Notes
